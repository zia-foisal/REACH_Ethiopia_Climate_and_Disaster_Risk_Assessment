# REACH_Ethiopia_Climate_and_Disaster_Risk_Assessment

This repository stores the codes used for the REACH Ethiopia climate and disaster risk assessment. The assessment aims to evaluate the potential impacts of climate change and natural disasters on population, built-up and agricultural sectors in Ethiopia, providing valuable insights for risk management and mitigation strategies.

The methodology and code were adapted from the [Risk Data Library Standard](https://riskdatalibrary.org/) tools developed by the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR). These tools are designed to facilitate the analysis of risk data, enabling users to generate comprehensive risk assessments and develop effective disaster risk reduction plans.

The REACH Ethiopia project leverages these tools to analyze climate and disaster risk data, helping to identify vulnerable areas and populations. The insights gained from this assessment are crucial for informing policy decisions and enhancing the resilience of communities in Ethiopia.
