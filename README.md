# REACH Ethiopia Climate and Disaster Risk Assessment February 2025

This repository contains the code used for the REACH Ethiopia climate and disaster risk assessment February 2025. The assessment aims to evaluate the potential impacts of climate change and natural disasters on the population, built-up areas, and agricultural sectors in Ethiopia, providing valuable insights for risk management and mitigation strategies.

The methodology and code were adapted from the [Risk Data Library Standard](https://riskdatalibrary.org/) developed by the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR). These tools facilitate the analysis of risk data, enabling users to generate comprehensive risk assessments and develop effective disaster risk reduction plans.

Please refer to the World Bank - GFDRR RDL tools [**DOCUMENTATION**](https://gfdrr.github.io/CCDR-tools/).

The REACH Ethiopia climate risk analytics project uses advanced tools to analyze climate and disaster risk data, identifying vulnerable areas and populations. The insights from this assessment are crucial for informing policy decisions and enhancing community resilience in Ethiopia, supporting both development and humanitarian agencies, as well as government bodies.
